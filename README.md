# Store-API-Tutorial

## About the project
This is a simple API project that I built during a tutorial series.

## SQL Script
Inside the "SqlScript" folder, you will find an SQL script file. You can run this script in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (MSSMS) to create the database used in the tutorial.

### How to use the SQL script
1. Open MSSMS and connect to your database server.
2. Open the SQL script file in MSSMS.
3. Execute the script to create the database and its tables.
4. The database will be ready for use with the API project.
